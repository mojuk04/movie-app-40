1.  Organise sport activities.
    Sports is one of the few ways to bring the hostel community together and it also helps paint a better picture of the team to the hostelites, especially the new students.

2.  Organise a help committee for the hostel, and this should not just be a question and
    answer forum, we need to let our fellow hostelites know we hear their complaints and we are really working on those complaints - the only way to show them we hear and understand is by giving them results.

3.  Organise less noisy but more impactful social events, like picnics - this is for the
    sole purpose of bringing hostelites together, not just to dance and get drunk, if we are going to have social events, let's have the good ones, not just movie nights or dance parties

4.  Make discipline the order of the day - i.e 0 tolerance to social vices and
    irresponsible behaviour from the hostelites.

        		Setting up a decentralized help desk for the whole hostel community.

    Setting this up makes sure hostelites don’t have to report happenings to the high body which might take a long time, instead, they can report to the representative close to them and the team can collectively take action

Organising less noisy social events
Our events don’t always to be parties for people to get drunk or misbehave - we can organise other social gatherings to help hostelites bond easily

Organising sporting activities and competitions
Sports is one of the few ways we can catch young peoples’ interest, organising these competitions would make hostelites want to be a part of a journey and it wouldn’t be difficult to convince them to participate

Making discipline the order of the day
We need to have a hostel community that is not filled with social vices, making law breakers pay for their actions.
